This is to make a function that reverses an incoming array of ints.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
This is to make a function that reverses an incoming array of ints. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
It is O(n) for both time and efficiency because it goes through every element in the array. A replace in-place solution would be faster and use less storage.
